# Image slider

Again, thereâ€™s not much instruction needed here - just practice.

Create a simple image carousel. It should contain arrows on each side to advance the image forward or backward. It should automatically move forward every 5 seconds. It should contain the little navigation circles at the bottom that indicate which slide you are on (and they should be click-able to advance to that particular slide).
